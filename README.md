I’m **Neha Dhirendra Sirur**, a Computer Science graduate (2025) from **KLE Technological University, Hubballi**, currently working as a **Software Engineer (Full-Stack)** at **Allstate India**.  
I specialize in **full-stack Java development** using **Spring Boot, React, and SQL/NoSQL databases**, with a strong interest in building **scalable, production-ready systems**.

I’m a full-stack developer with a passion for **AI-driven solutions**, continually advancing my knowledge in **Java, Spring Boot, and Data Science**.  
With **six research publications** in areas like **explainable AI, generative music synthesis, multilingual text classification, and multimodal learning**, I’m dedicated to merging **innovative research with practical applications**—take a look at my work on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=7obJF9UAAAAJ).
